I found a work around so that you may not have to resize all of the note photos, but if you do not like how it looks,
remove the css property called 'object-fit' that I added in style.css under the .image selector. The note photos are
squished because they are not a square size, so if they could be resized to be square that should fix it. Just name
the resized photos with the same names as they had before for the game to keep functioning.
